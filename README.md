- What problem does your app solve?
    Provide a curated list of song / playlist based on user's input / favorite songs / liked songs
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
    Curated song list based on user's mood (input)
    Linear regresion (train on what the song is based on genre, mood, dancibility, beat, classification, tempo)
    React UI / Backend: Authentication
    React UI: Create playlist, add liked / favorite, add or remove songs, recomended songs
    Backend tables: Playlist, User, Song, Favorites table
    Marketing: Landing Page, About / Team Page


- What is the mission statement?

    Curate the best list of songs

# üí° Features

---

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
    
    **DS:**

    1. Build a model to recommend songs based on similarity to user input (I like song `x`, here are `n` songs like it based on these similar features)
    2. Create visualizations using song data to highlight similarities and differences between recommendations.

    **Web:**

    1. User registration / login flow
    2. User can save their favorite songs to their profile in the Web backend
    3. Once the user has their favorites saved the DS API can make suggestions based on the audio features of their favorites.
    4. User can request suggested songs based on what they are in the mood for ( acousticness, danceability, duration, energy, etc)
    5. User can edit and delete their favorites.

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

    Most repeated songs list
    Favorites from the last months of listened songs
